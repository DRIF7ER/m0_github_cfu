# **Git Commands Charles Knows**

## `git init`
> Initializes "git" inside of what ever directory you are currently in.

## `git status`
> Displays the status of the project btween your local repo and the remote repo. Typically used to see if you have added your changes to the staging area.

## `git diff`
> Displays what is different between local and remote repos. How many lines have been added, deletions, etc.

## `git log`
> Shows a log of the git commits made in that repo. There is a flag that you can add to display just the commit messages but I can't remember what it is just now.
